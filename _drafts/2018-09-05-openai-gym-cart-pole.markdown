# Portfolio Optimization

When we talk about porfolio optimization, we mean choosing the optimal allocation for each stock in our portfolio. An even harder optimization problem, which isn't usually what is meant by portfolio optimization, is choosing the stocks themselves, along with finding the optimal allocations that maximize return. This is obviously a much, much harder problem since the stocks themselves are changing, and for each change we need to find the optimal allocations. Basically this is the first optimization problem replicated a little more than n factorial times, n being the number of tradeable stocks in the given stock market. 

A problem with a search space of this size forces simplification to become feasible.
