### Description

A hoarding grandma wants to get past hordes of infected people to get to the grocery store, while also avoiding her lover The Professor, who seems to get in her way every time she's out of the house!

Rain havoc on the world with your slippers! Slap those sick people away from you and maintain social distancing!

The whole map, enemy placement, flowers, shrubs, bushes, trees, tiles, bosses, and objectives are procedurally generated (Phew!).  The beautiful map you see as a background is an example of one run. Give it a go and see what you get! We challenge you to get past day 5 ..( Someone's long lost brother shows up uhm.. )

A short 48 hour game jam submission. Theme: Pack. Interpreted as "Ndabbo" in Lebanese, where the grandma slaps people to stay away and go home as to not get sick or infect her, and also as "pack" by hoarding supplies for the lockdown, hence the name "pack to the future" which would mean hoard.
