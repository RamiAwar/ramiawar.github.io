### What is this?

This is a second year engineering control systems project, for a course given by Dr. Naseem Daher at the American University of Beirut ( EECE 460). In this project, my team and I presented multiple controller designs for both the speed and position control of a direct-current motor, while abiding to requirements set in order to control an engraving laser.

For both speed and position control, proportional, PID, lag-lead, and full-state feedback controllers are investigated, and experimental results from a Quanser Qube Servo that nearly matches the mathematical model are compared with simulation results from that model.

The PID controller design in both systems meets the requirements with the least error and is thus chosen as the final design.
