An Arduino MEGA based wooden boat, running on high performance batteries. This was created to compete in the American University of Beirut's Robotics Club organized Engineering Design Challenge 1.0 . The boat is controlled with high torque motors guided by 3 ultrasonic sensors running a proportional control algorithm to maintain a constant direction from side walls. Below are some videos taken during construction.

Acknowledgments:  This project wouldn't have been possible without the construction and brainstorming skills of Tarek Tohme, and Alexandre Megarbane's swimming skills ðŸ˜„.
