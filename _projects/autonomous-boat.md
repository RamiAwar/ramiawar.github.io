An Arduino MEGA based wooden boat, running on high performance batteries. This was created to compete in the American University of Beirut's Robotics Club organized Engineering Design Challenge 1.0, during our second semester at the university in 2016. The boat is controlled with high torque motors guided by 3 ultrasonic sensors running a proportional control algorithm to maintain a constant direction from side walls. Below are some videos taken during construction.

Acknowledgments:  This project wouldn't have been possible without the construction and brainstorming skills of Tarek Tohme, and Alexandre Megarbane's swimming skills ðŸ˜„.

### Challenges

* Designing a stable structure that allows for speed, control, and protection for the electronics.
* Getting a sense of direction while in the pool.

### Solutions

* A catamaran structure with both hubs hollow to fit electronics, and sealed with silicon. The wood was curved by submersion in hot water and then formed into the final shape. Balsa wood was used for its light weight and high malleabillity. 
* Ultrasonic sensors were fitted on the sides to determine the distance to the side of the pool and thus provide an error to control and minimize.
