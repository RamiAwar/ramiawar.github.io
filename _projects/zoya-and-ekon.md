### What is it?

A game demo of two child protagonists attempting to escape an enslaver's dungeon, created in 48 hours for a local gamejam. The player can control both characters,

which have to cooperate to solve the puzzles. Switching characters can be done by the press of a button. Avoid the enemy at all costs! Don't let him spot you or its over.

### Features

So far I've implemented a basic demo puzzle, an enemy AI to avoid, and the character controllers and switching mechanisms.

That is in addition to modelling the characters, texturing and animating them, modelling the environment pieces, and polishing lighting and visual effects.

The game is free to play for the windows platform on [my itch.io page](https://ramiawar.itch.io), where there are some other games available as well.
