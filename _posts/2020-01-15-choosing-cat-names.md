## Choosing Cat Names

I recently got my first cat, and had trouble naming him. I tried to find some guidelines based in science for naming pets, but couldn't find anything concrete. In the expenditure of a strange day (or 3), I kind of got carried away writing the below guide. In the end, I chose the name Sesame ( which translates to 'Simsom' in Lebanese Arabic ), with the help of these guidelines. Have fun!
