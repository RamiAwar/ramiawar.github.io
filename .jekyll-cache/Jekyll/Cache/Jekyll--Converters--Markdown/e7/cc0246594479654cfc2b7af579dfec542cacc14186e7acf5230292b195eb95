<p>A game demo of two child protagonists attempting to escape an enslaverâ€™s dungeon, created in 48 hours for a local gamejam. The player can control both characters,</p>

<p>which have to cooperate to solve the puzzles. Switching characters can be done by the press of a button. Avoid the enemy at all costs! Donâ€™t let him spot you or its over.</p>

<h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Learning modelling, rigging, animating, and texturing 3D models from scratch in Blender.</li>
  <li>Creating a 3D character controller with smooth animation transitions between different states and beautiful camera positioning.</li>
  <li>Basic combat system development; collision detection using custom swords was hard to implement as the visuals were not pleasing.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="features">Features</h3>

<p>So far Iâ€™ve implemented a basic demo puzzle, an enemy AI to avoid, and the character controllers and switching mechanisms.</p>

<p>That is in addition to modelling the characters, texturing and animating them, modelling the environment pieces, and polishing lighting and visual effects.</p>

<p>The game is free to play for the windows platform on <a href="https://ramiawar.itch.io">my itch.io page</a>, where there are some other games available as well.</p>
