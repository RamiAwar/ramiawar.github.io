<p>A personal project Iâ€™ve been working on for 2 months during this quarantine. It is a desktop application development framework that allows for the development of C++ applications with a GUI and Renderer (Only OpenGL backend supported so far, but architecture leaves room for Vulkan, Metal, or DirectX extensions).</p>

<h3 id="features">Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Custom type-agnostic Entity Component System that utilizes virtual memory and custom allocators</li>
  <li>Dockable ImGui based GUI with custom components</li>
  <li>Profiling classes (Adapted to chrome tracing, and built with a live graph viewer)</li>
  <li>2D Custom batch renderer</li>
  <li>Custom shader library (GLSL)</li>
  <li>Orthographic camera + controller</li>
  <li>Minimal dependencies on other libraries</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="future-work">Future Work</h3>

<p>The engine is still far from usable to create games. Work in progress.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Functional game example</li>
  <li>Visual game creation capabilities</li>
  <li>Scripting language</li>
  <li>Game exporting</li>
  <li>Update linux, macosx support (one month late)</li>
</ul>
